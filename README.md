# Project Title

## Overview
This project is built using Python and integrates various libraries for data processing, image manipulation, and interactive UI development. The primary goal of this project is to provide a seamless and interactive experience for users through a web-based interface while efficiently handling data and images.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following key Python libraries:

- **Streamlit**: For building interactive web applications.
- **OS & SYS**: For system-level operations and file handling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation, numerical computations, and analytics.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For advanced image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For working with image files, including opening, manipulating, and saving them.
- **IO**: For handling in-memory file operations efficiently.

## Features
- **Interactive Web UI**: Developed using Streamlit, providing real-time interaction with the application.
- **Advanced Image Processing**: Leveraging OpenCV and Pillow for operations such as filtering, transformations, and feature extraction.
- **Data Analytics & Handling**: Pandas and NumPy allow efficient manipulation and visualization of data.
- **Efficient File Management**: Utilizing OS and IO to ensure smooth file operations.

## Installation
Before running the project, ensure that Python is installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install streamlit pandas numpy opencv-python pillow
```

## Usage
To start the application, execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

Once executed, a local server will start, and the application UI will be accessible via a web browser.


## Acknowledgments
This project was conceptualized and implemented as part of a hackathon at Nirma University. Special thanks to the mentors, organizers, and fellow participants who contributed their insights and expertise to make this project a success.
